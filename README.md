## What even is this

As the title says, this is a lousy / horrible / extremely useless 3d engine written in javascript.

I use the Processing library to draw the triangles. 

I project every triangle to the 3D space using maths and stuff. I don't even use any kind of matrices. Can you imagine a 3D engine without matrices? Now you can.

It's so inefficient the Mario model from SM64 already lags. Outrageous!
